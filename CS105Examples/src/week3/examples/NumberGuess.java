 * The problem is to guess what number a computer has in mind. 
 * You will write a program that randomly generates an integer between 10 and 99, 
 * inclusive. 
 * The program prompts the user to enter a number continuously until the number 
 * matches the randomly generated number. For each user input, 
 * the program tells the user whether the input is too low or too high, 
 * so the user can make the next guess intelligently
